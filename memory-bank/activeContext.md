# Active Context - GitLab Migration Tool

## Current Work Focus

### Phase: Bug Fixes and Enhancements Complete

We have successfully implemented fixes for two critical migration issues:

1. **Repository Owner Mapping**: Fixed user-owned project migration to properly map owners to migrated users
2. **Repository Disk Conflicts**: Enhanced error handling to gracefully skip repositories with disk conflicts instead of failing the entire migration

The GitLab migration tool now handles these edge cases robustly and provides better error reporting and cleanup.

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Technology Stack**: Python selected as the primary language

   - Rationale: Best balance of API libraries, error handling, CLI frameworks, and testing tools
   - Core libraries: requests, click, pydantic, asyncio/aiohttp, rich

2. **Architecture Pattern**: Layered architecture with clear separation of concerns

   - CLI Interface → Migration Orchestrator → Service Layer → Data Access Layer
   - Design patterns: Command, Strategy, Factory, Observer, Repository

3. **Migration Approach**: API-based migration using GitLab REST APIs
   - Primary: Direct transfer via GitLab's bulk import APIs
   - Fallback: Individual entity migration via standard APIs
   - Repository handling: Git protocol for repository cloning/pushing
