# Product Context - GitLab Migration Tool

## Problem Statement

Organizations frequently need to migrate their GitLab instances due to:

- **Infrastructure Changes**: Moving from self-hosted to GitLab.com or vice versa
- **Organizational Restructuring**: Merging or splitting GitLab instances
- **Compliance Requirements**: Moving to different geographic regions or security zones
- **Performance Optimization**: Upgrading to more powerful infrastructure
- **Cost Optimization**: Consolidating multiple instances

## Current Pain Points

### Manual Migration Challenges

- **Time-Intensive**: Manual export/import processes are extremely slow
- **Error-Prone**: High risk of data loss or corruption during manual transfers
- **Incomplete Transfers**: Missing metadata, broken relationships, lost history
- **Downtime**: Extended service interruptions during migration
- **Scalability Issues**: Manual processes don't scale for large organizations

### Existing Tool Limitations

- **GitLab Native Tools**: Limited to specific use cases, not comprehensive
- **Third-Party Solutions**: Often expensive, proprietary, or incomplete
- **Custom Scripts**: Usually one-off solutions, not reusable or maintainable
