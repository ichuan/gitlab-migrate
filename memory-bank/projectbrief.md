# GitLab Migration Tool - Project Brief

## Project Overview

Create a comprehensive tool for migrating users, repositories, groups, and projects from one GitLab instance (A) to another GitLab instance (B) using API-based migration approaches.

## Core Requirements

### Migration Scope

- **Users**: Migrate user accounts with proper contribution mapping
- **Groups**: Migrate group hierarchies and permissions
- **Projects**: Migrate projects with full metadata preservation
- **Repositories**: Migrate Git repositories with complete history

### Technical Approach

- **API-Based Migration**: Primary method using GitLab REST APIs
- **Direct Transfer**: Leverage GitLab's built-in migration features
- **Batch Processing**: Handle large-scale migrations efficiently
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and retry mechanisms

### Key Features Required

1. **User Management**

   - Extract users from source instance
   - Create users on destination instance
   - Map contributions by email matching
   - Handle user permissions and roles

2. **Group Migration**

   - Preserve group hierarchies
   - Maintain group permissions
   - Handle nested subgroups
   - Transfer group settings and metadata

3. **Project Migration**

   - Complete project data transfer
   - Preserve issues, merge requests, CI/CD pipelines
   - Maintain project permissions
   - Transfer wikis and snippets

4. **Repository Migration**
   - Full Git history preservation
   - All branches and tags
   - Repository settings and hooks
   - Large file support (LFS)

### Success Criteria

- Zero data loss during migration
- Preserved user contributions and authorship
- Maintained permission structures
- Functional CI/CD pipelines post-migration
- Minimal downtime during migration process

### Constraints

- Both instances must be accessible via HTTPS
- Admin access required on both instances
- Compatible GitLab versions (destination >= source)
- Sufficient storage space for temporary data
- Network connectivity between instances

## Deliverables

1. Migration tool with CLI interface
2. Configuration management system
3. Progress tracking and reporting
4. Error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. Documentation and usage guides
6. Validation and verification tools
